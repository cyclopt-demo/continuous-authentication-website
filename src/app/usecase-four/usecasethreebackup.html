    <h3>Third Use Case Scenario: Writing paragraphs</h3>

    <div class="info">
        The present and last use case scenario is also very simple: Pure writing of a given text.
        <br> We present you this case scenario in order to get as much as keystroke data we can from your patterns and timings in order to create a keystroke profile that matches as much as possible your real one.
        <br>
        <br> You are given three paragraphs, containing random sentences from random texts and the only thing you have to do is type the text you see to the textarea below.
        <br> Of course you don't have to type all the text you see, but the more text you type, the higher the probability of the system of kicking a hacker out of your profile. &#9786;
